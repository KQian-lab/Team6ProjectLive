## Vision: what would you tell potential customers?
Our space game is an action-packed galactic shooter that tests your reflexes and skills as you pilot your spacecraft through a relentless onslaught of alien invaders. Taking control of your ship's weapons systems, you'll blast across the cosmos, facing off against wave after wave of hostile forces.

- Have face-to-face discussions: Conduct weekly Zoom meetings and Discord calls to discuss anything related to the project.
- Measure Progress: Use Burndown charts to track and improve progress.
- Keep things simple: Follow the K.I.S.S philosophy and keep realistic expectations 
- Lean manufacturing: Focus on minimizing waste
