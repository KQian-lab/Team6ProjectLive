- Add multiple spaceships, obstacles, and items.
- Adjust screen scaling to fit browser size

### Any known problems (bugs, issues)
- Not immediately game over even if hit by a meteor.
- Redirect to an error page that should not be shown to users, intended for developers only, when an exception is detected in user input during signup

### Reflection
