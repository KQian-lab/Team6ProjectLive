### What we were in the middle of implementing

### What we had planned for the future
- Improve User interface.
- Increase the difficulty of the game based on the score obtained or the elapsed time. Currently, the difficulty level is constant.
- Implement sign-out functionality.
- Maintain sign-in status with cookies.
- Add multiple spaceships, obstacles, and items.
- Adjust screen scaling to fit browser size

### Any known problems (bugs, issues)
- Not immediately game over even if hit by a meteor.
- Redirect to an error page that should not be shown to users, intended for developers only, when an exception is detected in user input during signup
